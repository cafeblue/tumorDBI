# tumorDBI

A set or R scripts to query the database and plot.

1. heatmap of all the SNVs of tumor samples and the number of shared mutation between them.
2. heatmap of all the INDELs of tumor samples and the number of shared mutation between them.
3. table/plot of the genes which have mutations/INDELs in at least two tumor samples.
4. table of Current Investigated sample and the nonsynonymous Mutations on the same gene.
5. table of Common substitutions between current investigated sample and other samples.
6. plot of mutation burden of all tumor samples.
7. plot of Overall Coverage
8. exon coverage plot.
9. plot of Coverage distribution of Exons of all genes.
10. Coverage distribution of Exons of certain gene
